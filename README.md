# 🛍️ FitAR : Augmented Reality for Online Stores 

## Overview
This project implements a **virtual trial room** experience to enhance online clothing shopping using **Augmented Reality (AR)**. By leveraging computer vision and pose estimation techniques, users can see how clothes would look on them based on the uploaded photos.

Originally built as a college minor project in 2019, the system uses:
- 📦 **TensorFlow** for model deployment  
- 🤖 **PoseNet** for multi-person pose detection  
- 🧠 **Multi-pose estimation** to simulate virtual try-on
